# Shopping app Backend

This project simulates an e-commerce web site's back end. Also, my team mate who is a well talented android developer, created a great androind app using kotlin. I will leave a link down below so you can check that out as well. 
I've used elasticsearch for fuzzy search and postgresql for permanent data storage.




## Installation

You can use docker-compose file in order to run project.

Please also note that if you want to use it with sample data you can email me for sql files. Github didn't allow to upload large files. But for clean start you can change ddl configuration to create-drop in application.properties file.

```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose up
```
    
## API Reference

Me and my android developer mate both used swagger during development phase of project so you can do as well.
