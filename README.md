# Shopping app Backend

This project simulates an e-commerce web site's back end. Also, my team mate who is a well talented android developer, created a great androind app using kotlin. I will leave a link down below so you can check that out as well. 
I've used elasticsearch for fuzzy search and postgresql for permanent data storage.




## Installation

This docker-compose file is for ElasticSearch.

```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose up
```
    
## API Reference

#### Swagger
#### /Shopping-app-swagger-ui.html

Me and my android developer mate both used swagger during development phase of project so you can do as well.
